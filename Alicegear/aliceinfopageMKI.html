<h1>The Basics of Alice LC-2 </h1>
<p>
    All Purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment or Alice is a
    type of belt and suspenders load bearing equipment used by the United
    States from 1973 to around 2006 but don't let age fool you, the old girl is still
    viable option for civilian use. While it may not be the most high spped, or fancy tactical gear 
    out there, its cost effectiveness and durability makes it a perfect choice for those 
    on a budget, or if you have a lot of people on your team to equip.

<h2>The Author's set up</h2>
<img src="Pictures/AliceRifle.jpg" width="700" height="300" alt="Author's setup">
<p>
    This setup is multipurpose as it can be used for both Airsoft and real steel
    which is jargon for actual firearms, but for this specific example, we
    are going to use airsoft. This is what could be reffered to as a riflemans
    setup, starting from left to right, consisting of
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Two magazine pouches with grenade pouches holding three 30 round
        STANAG magazines each or three airsoft M4 pattern magazines. One on each side! </li>
    <li>One US M12 Universal Holster with KWA M9 PTP but can also hold an M1911</li>
    <li>One butt pack which should be used for sustainment</li>
    <li>One SAW gunners pouch, being used as a dump pouch for spent mags</li>
    <li>One M3 clip on bipod pouch, with bipod. Not needed urgently </li>
    <li>One 2 mag M1911 bianchi magazine pouch M1025</li>
    <li>One Fulton Flashlight stuffed in second M4 Mag pouch. However it is advised to
        not use the Flashlight so it doesn't get shot out by a BB </li>

</ul>

    This system is modular for all of you milsimmers out there. Any Alice 
    pouch will fit securely on this system thanks to the slide keepers, which are
    actually a carry over from the M1956 and M1967 canvas rigs from the vietnam era.
    Due to this fact, any pouch from the two previous systems will work with Alice
    seamlessly, in fact the butt pack was a carry over from the previous, however is not
    pictured here. Alice is a nylon, while the other two are a cotton canvas,
    which while durable traps water when wet and gets heavy, Alice doesn't have
    this problem. Another item that will work with alice is the LBV-88 (Load Bearing Vest 88)
    which was designed to improve and use Alice in the 1990's and replace the older Y straps. 
    While you could use this vest by itself, it works better with an Alice belt. The LBV 88 holds
    six M4 pattern magazines and two grenade pouches (if you can afford Pyrotechnic grenades as the Co2
    grenades will not fit) so if you set it up right, you could double your ammunition count, which 
    for milsim events, longer running skirmish games, or just a game that gets extremely hot and contested
    the more magazines the better.
